Hunt The Wumpus: Discord Edition
================================
If you've used Discord for any amount of time, chances are you've spotted a friendly little creature called the Wumpus lurking in the background. "Where did it come from?", you might ask. While it may look cute and harmless, the Wumpus has a dark past. In ye olde days, when computers were the size of refrigerators, the Wumpus was hunted for... sport? We know not the motivations of the Wumpus hunters but it was quite a tricky task. You see, the Wumpus is native to dark, winding caves where a would-be hunter can easily find themself walking in circles. Making matters worse, the caves are filled with deep pits and super bats!

Lore aside, Hunt The Wumpus was a text-based survival game written by Gregory Yob in 1973. For Discord Hack Week, we decided to port the original game to a Discord bot format. We hope you enjoy the hunt!
